# System Design Capstone Journal Overview
This journal keeps record of thoughts, research, problems encountered, and solutions implemented as I journey through the System Design Capstone (SDC) project at Hack Reactor.
The System Design Capstone project is an efficiency-first project meant to mimic real world application scaling issues and practices in a system-oriented architecture framework. Using legacy code from Front End Capstone projects written by other Hack Reactor attendees, we now face the challenge of understanding a code base we didn't write, seeding a database with 10 million+ records, comparing the read/write efficiency of SQL and No-SQL databases, and producing a performant microservice with optimal back end design.
