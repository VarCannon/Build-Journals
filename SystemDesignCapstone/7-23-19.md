 ## **Challenges Faced**
 
Researching SDC goals and coming up with sprint goals
Reviewing legacy code base
Had trouble cloning proxy from legacy code base


## **Actions Taken**

Set up **trello** board with small tasks for the first 2 day sprint. May move some to the following sprint. 
Reviewed the docs from *learn* that explained how to set up the GitHub Organization
and set up repos as well as how to approach the project.  
Spun up previous teams proxy from local machine to check out the site. 
Also forked a copy of the component to organization github.

## **Results/Take-aways**
Today was mostly dev-ops tasks and spending time with the team trying to familiarize ourselves with the problem space.
In my previous build I don't think we utilized the ticketing system or TDD as much as we should have. 
I'm optimistic we can change that on this sprint.
