 ## **Challenges Faced**
 
Continued research on problem space. 
Server routes written with callbacks instead of promises.
Serving the inherited app locally.
The code base was set up to hit a deployed SQL database, I want to use a Mongo database.
Set up Database(s)



## **Actions Taken**
Serving the app locally was pretty simple. 
Cloned it down from the legacy repo, reset the environmental variables. 
Finished reading the reference documents Hack Reactor provided. I'll need to revisit these later in the project.
They didn't have much useful info for the scoping/set up of the project. 
I set up a local mongo database and created some methods to query it and added them to the code base. 

## **Results/Take-aways**
It was a productive day. I got a much better handle on the code base.
Unfortunately I won't be able to use very much of the back end. 
The database methods are a getAll and a post. I made a getOne to test with.
Main take-away, try not to change the codebase unecessarily, but recognize when its necessary and then act.
